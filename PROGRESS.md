# Debian 13 (trixie) on the DragonBox Pyra — progress log

Running timeline of what has actually been done, in order, with what each step
established. Newest work goes at the bottom.

Companion documents: `TRIXIE.md` is the procedure and the reference. This file
is the history. Where the two disagree, `TRIXIE.md` is the one to trust for
*how*, this one for *when* and *why*.

Times are local (US Eastern). Entries marked **reported** were observed by the
operator on the device rather than verified on the PC.

## Before this project

**2026-02-01** — Upstream publishes `pyra-trixie-t1-brokenxorg.7z`, the t1
build, to `packages.pyra-handheld.com/images/trixie/`. 862,273,362 bytes,
expanding to a 6 GiB image. An older pre-t1 build from 2025-06-28 sits beside
it and is not the one to use.

The "brokenxorg" in the filename is accurate as shipped.

## 2026-09-07 — research and preparation, no hardware

Written up from a Pyra forum post, "Debian 13 (trixie) working on the Pyra:
three fixes", reported working on a V5.3 unit.

- `TRIXIE.md` written: the buy/write/fix/boot procedure, the three fixes and
  what they do, rejected alternatives, and troubleshooting.
- `pyra-trixie-prep.sh` written to apply the three fixes offline against a
  mounted rootfs, replacing the fragile parts of the forum procedure. Notably
  it uses `useradd --root` instead of appending raw lines to `/etc/passwd`,
  prompts for the password instead of putting it in shell history, and probes
  for a DRI driver instead of hardcoding one.
- Upstream image confirmed still present.

Status at end of day: blocked on hardware. No SD card.

## 2026-09-08 — pre-flight, card written, first boot

### 20:52 — image acquired

Download started and the target card inspected in parallel. The card at
`/dev/sdi` is a 128 GB SDXC in a USB reader, factory exFAT, mounted read-only
to confirm it was empty. It was.

Downloaded archive matched the upstream `content-length` exactly.

### 20:54 – 21:00 — pre-flight against the loop-mounted image

This is the step that paid for itself. Four documented assumptions were wrong.

| Assumption | Reality |
| --- | --- |
| Rootfs is ext4 | **f2fs.** Needs `modprobe f2fs` to mount |
| First-run script is in `/usr/bin` | **`/usr/share/pyra/scripts/pyra-first-run.sh`** |
| `/etc/pyrainput.cfg` exists | **Missing**, and shipped by no package in either suite |
| U-Boot location unstated | **Raw sectors before partition 1**, so only a whole-device write works |

Confirmed correct, on the other hand:

- `armsoc_dri.so` is genuinely absent, so fix 1 is needed. `kms_swrast_dri.so`
  is present as a symlink into mesa 25.0.7's `libdril_dri.so` megadriver, so
  the script's first probe hits.
- The first-run marker really is `/var/lib/pyra/first-run.done`, and it is the
  `ConditionPathExists=!` guard on `pyra-first-run.service`, which is enabled
  in `graphical.target.wants`. Touching the marker disables the wizard at the
  systemd level rather than relying on the script's own logic.
- The image has **no user accounts at all** and an empty `/home`. The wizard
  was the only thing that would ever have created one, so skipping it without
  creating a user offline leaves no way to log in.
- Every group the prep script wants exists in the image.
- The display manager is **lightdm**, not slim, despite the wizard still
  carrying slim-theme code.
- The wizard calls `poweroff` on its success path too, not only on cancel.

**Fix 3 verified properly** by downloading both the bookworm and trixie
`funkeymonkey-pyrainput` packages and diffing their contents. Same version
0.1.19. Bookworm ships `lib/systemd/system/pyrainput.service`; trixie does not.
The unit the prep script writes is byte-identical to bookworm's, so it is a
faithful restore rather than a reconstruction. A scan of all 68 pyra packages
in each suite found no package shipping `/etc/pyrainput.cfg` in either, so that
gap is not a trixie regression.

### 21:00 — prep script patched

Two changes, both from pre-flight findings:

- Widened the first-run search to `/usr/share/pyra` and `/usr/lib/systemd/system`
  so it verifies the marker path instead of falling back to a warned guess.
- Create `/etc/pyrainput.cfg` empty when absent, which is what `pyrainputctl`
  does on first use, rather than only warning. Without it `libpyrainput` logs
  `ERROR: Could not open config file` and the unit is `Restart=on-failure`.

### 21:03 — fixes applied to the image

Prep script run by the operator against the loop-mounted rootfs, so the
password prompt stayed interactive and never passed through the session.

Verified afterwards: `armsoc_dri.so` resolving to a real file, the marker
present, user `pyra` at uid 1000 with a `$6$` hash, `/home/pyra` owned 1000:1000
and populated from skel, `gshadow` agreeing with `group` on every group, the
unit installed and enabled, and the empty config created.

The gshadow check matters: disagreement between `group` and `gshadow` is the
exact corruption the forum procedure's hand-editing produces, and it makes
`useradd` refuse to run later.

### 21:07 – 21:15 — card written

Whole-device write to `/dev/sdi`, behind a guard that re-checked size,
removable flag and absence of mounts before writing. Because the fixes went
onto the image first, the card was written once, already fixed.

    6442450944 bytes copied, 480.934 s, 13.4 MB/s

### 21:15 – 21:21 — write verified

- Readback of the first 6 GiB off the card is md5-identical to the fixed image.
- Partitions read back as `boot` (ext2) and `rootfs` (f2fs) with PARTUUIDs
  `21a4c285-01` and `-02`, matching what `fstab` and `extlinux.conf` reference.
  These derive from the MBR disk identifier, so the whole-device write kept
  them valid with no fixup.
- U-Boot SPL present in the raw gap on the card.
- All three fixes present on the card's own filesystem.

### 21:22 — repository created

The directory had no version control despite living under `~/git/`. Initialised
and committed, with the image and archive gitignored.

### 21:34 — first boot **(reported)**

The card boots. Reaches multi-user with networking, and is reachable over SSH
as `pyra` at <usb-address>.

**lightdm fails and there is no desktop.** This is the open problem. Worth
noting that the forum writeup only ever demonstrated a desktop through the bare
`xinit` session the first-run wizard used, which is not the code path lightdm
takes, so fix 1 may simply not cover this case.

---

## Open items

- **lightdm failure.** Unknown cause. Check journalctl for lightdm,
  `/var/log/lightdm/` and `/var/log/Xorg.0.log` before assuming it is fix 1.
- **pyrainput never checked on hardware.** Confirm the service starts, that the
  three pyraInput devices appear, and that the empty config is accepted.
- **GLES2 through the SGX blob never checked.** `TRIXIE.md` section 6 has the
  expected output and the warning against using the DDK's own `gles2test1`.
- **Audio, wifi, bluetooth, battery and charging** all unverified.
- **113 GB of the card is unused.** The image is 6 GiB and nothing grows the
  rootfs on boot. Expanding means growing p2 and running `resize.f2fs`. Worth
  doing after the desktop works, not before.
- **f2fs cross-kernel caveat.** The rootfs was mounted read-write by a Linux 7.1
  host to apply the fixes, and the Pyra runs 5.6.19. The superblock feature set
  is unchanged and it unmounted with a clean checkpoint. It booted, so this
  appears to have been fine, but it was the one step not verifiable offline.
- **Upstream bug to file.** `funkeymonkey-pyrainput` 0.1.19 in the trixie repo
  ships no systemd unit while the identical version in bookworm does.
